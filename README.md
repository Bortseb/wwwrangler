 [Wrangle data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling) from/to any [website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website). This project comes after lots of imagining about browser extensions, but it only started to become more real when I started imagining simple things an extension could do with [Federated Wiki](https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki). Your data never leaves your device through this extension, but this extension does 

This extension so far is mostly just clippings from [mdn / webextensions-examples](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples) and other example code in the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) combined with learning and using the [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) command-line tool that lets you easily test and develop extensions, like on any of the examples in the repo above, in a private browser isolated from your other Firefox if you already use it.
